Great — here’s a **clear, practical Year 1 implementation plan** you can follow yourself **or hand directly to a gardener/landscaper**.  
This integrates:

✅ your Tudor woodland design  
✅ pachysandra + fern parking strip  
✅ terracotta urn placeholders for future fence  
✅ no wasted work later  
✅ Seattle climate best practices

I’ll structure this like a work order / project brief.

### 🌳 YEAR 1 LANDSCAPE PLAN — 1120 19th Ave E

**Goal:** Establish Tudor woodland street presence + prepare for future fence + build permanent foundation.

**Design intent:** English estate woodland edge → architectural entry structure.

---

### ⭐ YEAR 1 — WORK SCOPE OVERVIEW

## Permanent work

✔ Parking strip installation  
✔ Soil improvement + mulch base  
✔ Limited woodland extension near walkways

## Temporary work

✔ Terracotta urn placement at future fence line  
✔ Minimal planting in that zone

---

### 🪵 STEP 1 — Site Preparation (do first — most important)

## Scope

- Remove weeds/grass from parking strip and front woodland areas
- Remove invasive roots
- Light grading if needed
- Loosen top 4–6" soil

## Soil improvement

- Add 2–3" compost
- Till or mix into soil

## Woodland base

- Spread 2–3" arborist wood chips across front yard beds
- Keep 3–4" away from tree trunks

**Result:** woodland soil ecosystem + weed suppression.

### 🌿 STEP 2 — Install Parking Strip (Permanent)

#### Base layer — Pachysandra ‘Green Carpet’

##### Quantity

- ~400–450 plants total

##### Layout

- 8–10" staggered spacing
- Continuous carpet
- Avoid planting within 18" of trees

##### Planting method

1. Lay plants on grid first
2. Dig hole slightly larger than plug
3. Plant level with soil
4. Water deeply

---

#### Accent layer — Fern rhythm

##### Placement

- 3–4 ferns total
- 1 every ~10–12 ft
- Offset from center (natural placement)

##### Species

- Sword fern → bold
- Deer fern → refined

---

#### Finish

- Apply 2" bark mulch between plants
- Water thoroughly

---

### 🏺 STEP 3 — Install Terracotta Urn Placeholders (Future Fence Line)

#### Purpose

- Establish visual boundary where brick/wrought iron fence will go
- Create Tudor estate structure now
- Avoid permanent planting in construction zone

---

#### Recommended style

##### Size

- 18–24" diameter minimum
- 20–36" tall ideal

##### Quantity

- 2 (minimum) — at stair top
- Optional 2 more to suggest fence endpoints

---

#### Placement

Plain text

\[URN\]   stair landing   \[URN\]

or along future fence alignment.

---

#### Installation method

- Set on compacted gravel base (not soil)
- Ensure level
- Allow drainage hole

---

#### Planting inside urns (choose one)

##### Option A — Tudor evergreen structure (recommended)

- Boxwood
- Small yew
- Compact holly

##### Option B — Woodland character

- Fern
- Ivy
- Seasonal mix

---

### 🌲 STEP 4 — Limited Woodland Extension (Permanent but Small)

Extend planting slightly into yard:

##### Locations

- Under existing trees
- Along walkway edges
- Around stair base

##### Planting

- Pachysandra patches only
- No major shrubs yet

This connects parking strip to yard.

---

### 🚫 STEP 5 — Temporary Zone Treatment (Future Fence Area)

Do NOT heavily plant here.

##### Instead:

- Arborist chip mulch
- Sparse groundcover only
- Containers provide structure

Prevents removal later.

---

### 💧 STEP 6 — Watering Plan (Seattle Year 1)

##### First 3 months

- Water 2× weekly

##### First summer

- Deep soak weekly

##### After year 1

- Minimal watering required

---

### 📅 Recommended Timeline (Seattle)

| Month | Task |
| --- | --- |
| March–May | Ideal planting window |
| September–October | Also excellent |
| Summer | Avoid if possible |

---

### ⏱️ Expected Installation Time

| Task | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Site prep | 2–4 hrs |
| Parking strip planting | 3–5 hrs |
| Urn install | 1 hr |
| Woodland extension | 2 hrs |
| **Total** | 1–2 days |

---

### 💰 Year 1 Budget Reality

| Item | Typical cost |
| --- | --- |
| Pachysandra | $400–$1,200 |
| Ferns | $60–$200 |
| Terracotta urns | $300–$1,200 |
| Soil + mulch | $150–$400 |
| **Total DIY** | $900–$2,500 |
