## Notes
* Therapeutic Doses 
	* **Lion's Mane** — 500mg–3,000mg/day. This is the most studied for cognition. Most studies showing benefit used 1,000mg+ daily. Aim for at least 500mg per dose, ideally closer to 1,000mg if cognition is your primary goal.
	* **Reishi** — 1,000mg–5,000mg/day for general adaptogenic/stress effects (as whole mushroom). For extracts, 300mg–500mg of a concentrated extract (often standardized to polysaccharide content) is more typical. Wide range here because extract potency varies a lot.
	* **Cordyceps** — 1,000mg–3,000mg/day. Most athletic performance studies use 1,500mg–3,000mg. The lower end (~500mg) is unlikely to move the needle much.
	* **Chaga** — 1,000mg–2,000mg/day is common, though there's no strong human clinical dose established. Mostly used for antioxidant/immune support rather than cognition.
	* **Turkey Tail** — 1,000mg–3,000mg/day in most immune-focused research. Gut-brain benefits are more indirect and less dose-defined.
