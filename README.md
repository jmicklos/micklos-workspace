There are four major categories in PARA, each with a rules defined by the user. I define those rules thusly: 
1. **Projects** = has a *deadline* + *done state* (“Finish X”, “Plan trip Y”, “Remodel kitchen lighting”) 
2. **Areas** = ongoing responsibility with a standard to maintain (“Health”, “Finances”, “Home”, “Relationship”, “Work”)
3. **Resources** = reference/library (“Mezcal notes”, “Singapore restaurants”, “Obsidian tips”)
4. **Archive** = inactive projects + old areas/resources you don’t want in your face
