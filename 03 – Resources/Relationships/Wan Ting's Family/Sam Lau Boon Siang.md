Met at his place in Singapore

Notes on his words of wisdom:
- Don't let people know what you want / you intentions
	- If someone looks your direction, be quick to look the other way at someone else. It wasn't you. 
	- Don't tell people what you need / want until they need you. Be the dumb person until the right moment – only then light people know what you need. Spend a few years in silence just building. 
- Less IG Posting
- Passport 
- More Stoicism – but take only what you need from it
- Volume wins the day. Scale through a large populous for small amounts of money – e.g. if you just get a penny per transaction in China – you are rich. 
- If I'm going to sell my photography, just do something that completely different, something others don't do. If people understand what you are doing, then they can replicate it. Sell the intrigue of they can't do.
