# PARA Overview
### Overview
[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Mfl1OywM8)
* **Projects**: Any outcome you are actively committed to that requires multiple work sessions to complete. They are action oriented and short term. jTwo important features: 
	* Goal
	* Deadline

* **Area**: Role or responsibility you have with a standard you want to maintain over time. There is no goal. These are never complete. These are important/relevant on an ongoing basis. Not quite as actionable as projects. 
  
* **Resources**: Any topic of ongoing interest / reference. Catch all for everything else that you don't need to keep track of for a project / area, but could be valuable later. Examples include interesting subjects, random hobbies, places you'd like to visit some day, content/quotes, etc.
  
* **Archives**: Anything inactive from the previous three categories. This is cold storage. The key for archives is that when a project becomes inactive, just archive it. Rare to archive an entire area – but let's say you have a big life change. 

###  Recommendations on Making Actionable
1. Enumerate P.A.R.A. to keep it in order
2. 15-20 projects is common
3. Each project is a folder
4. When a resource becomes a project, you can just drag and drop it

# Tips
## The 3 Sizes of Project (Use This Mental Model)

### Micro Project (1–2 weeks)

- Buy engagement ring
- Set up Syncthing
- Replace 4Runner brakes

### Standard Project (2–8 weeks)

- Plan NYC road trip
- Launch new Obsidian workflow
- Source lighting for kitchen

### Mega Project (3+ months)

These are almost always better as:

- An **Area** containing multiple smaller projects

Example:  
“Wedding Planning” is an Area.  
“Book venue” is a Project.
