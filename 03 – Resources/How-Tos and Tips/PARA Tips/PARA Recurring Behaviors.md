# 🔹 **Daily PARA Habits (5–10 min total)**

These keep the system alive.

## 1️⃣ Capture → Inbox

- Dump ideas
- Tasks
- Links
- Notes
- Thoughts
- Meeting notes
- Random brain noise

**Obsidian flow:**

```
Daily note → inbox section
OR
Quick capture note → process later
```

👉 Rule: **never organize during capture**

---

## 2️⃣ Work From Projects (Not Tasks)

You should only execute from:

- Active project pages
- Today page

Ask:

```
What project does this action move forward?
```

If none → probably noise.

---

## 3️⃣ Update Project Status

While working:

- Add progress notes
- Check off tasks
- Adjust next actions
- Update status if blocked/paused

Projects are **living documents**.

---

## 4️⃣ Light Cleanup (Optional)

- Rename messy notes
- Add missing tags
- Link obvious things

But:

```
Never deep organize daily
```

---

# 🔹 **Weekly Review (Most Important — 30–60 min)**

This is the core engine of PARA.

If you do only one thing → do this.

---

## 1️⃣ Review All Active Projects

Ask for each:

- Is this still active?
- What is the next action?
- Is it stalled?
- Should it be paused or archived?

Update:

```
status: active / paused / completed
```

This prevents zombie projects.

---

## 2️⃣ Move Things Between PARA Buckets

Typical weekly moves:

```
Project finished → Archive
Temporary project → Area
Old reference → Archive
```

PARA is fluid, not rigid.

---

## 3️⃣ Process Inbox

Empty capture locations:

- Daily notes inbox
- Random notes
- Screenshots
- Downloads

Decision tree:

```
Actionable → Project
Ongoing responsibility → Area
Useful info → Resource
Done → Archive
```

---

## 4️⃣ Clean Project List

- Delete abandoned ideas
- Merge duplicates
- Clarify goals

Goal: small list of real commitments.

---

## 5️⃣ Look at Areas (Maintenance Check)

Areas are ongoing standards like:

- Health
- Finances
- Career
- Relationship
- Home

Ask:

```
Is anything slipping?
```

Areas generate new projects.

---

# 🔹 **Monthly / Quarterly Review (Deeper Reset — 1–2 hrs)**

This keeps your life direction aligned.

---

## 1️⃣ Review Areas of Responsibility

Check health of:

- Career
- Finances
- Relationships
- Home
- Learning
- Personal growth

Ask:

```
What needs improvement?
What deserves a new project?
```

---

## 2️⃣ Archive Aggressively

Move:

- Finished projects
- Old reference material
- Stale notes

Archive is not trash — it's frozen history.

---

## 3️⃣ Prune Resources

Resources grow infinitely without pruning.

Delete:

- Useless bookmarks
- Low-value notes
- Duplicates
- Old research

Keep signal high.

---

## 4️⃣ Strategic Direction Check

Ask:

```
Am I working on the right projects?
Do my projects reflect my priorities?
```

This prevents productivity theater.

---

# 🔹 **Yearly (Optional but Powerful)**

- Redefine areas
- Remove dead identities
- Change life focus
- Major archive cleanup

---

# 🧠 Mental Model of PARA Maintenance

```
Daily → Execute
Weekly → Control
Monthly → Improve
Yearly → Redirect
```

---

# ⭐ What Most People Get Wrong

### ❌ They over-organize daily

PARA is not a filing system — it's an action system.

---

### ❌ They skip weekly review

Then everything collapses.

---

### ❌ They treat areas as projects

Areas never finish.
